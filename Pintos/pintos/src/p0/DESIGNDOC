---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, or notes for the
>> TAs, please give them here.

>> text, lecture notes, and course staff.

			     Booting Pintos
			     ==============

---- QUESTIONS ---- 
>> Put the screenshots of Pintos running in src/p0.
>> A1: Is there any particular issue that you would like us to know?
//No

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

uint8_t input = 0;
//This will store the value taken from the input buffer.

int size = 10;
//Sets the length of my buffer.

char* buf = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*size);
//Initializes my buffer buf.

char* whoami = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*size);
whoami = "whoami\0";
//These two lines initialize var whoami to the string "whoami\0" to later
//compare my buffer buf to.

int index = 0;
//Declares variable to keep track of my buffer buf index.

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

//I read by using the function input_getc(), which retrieves a key from the input buffer.
//If the buffer is empty, waits for a key to be pressed.

//I wrote to the consol by using the putchar() function, which writes  an int C 
//to the vga display and serial port. 

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
//No
